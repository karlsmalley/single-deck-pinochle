# single-deck-pinochle

This version of single-deck partners pinochle is quite literally my Dad's version.
It is similar to a lot of other versions, but it has it's own little quirks.
There is no card passing. Talking the board is illegal (but irrelevant here).
Signal bidding is allowed, but I have not implemented it here.
Signal tricks (non-pointer of suit you are strong in when you fall off trump)
are also allowed but not implemented here.
Renigging is enforced, but not possible here unless I have a bug.
Each player bids once starting with player to left of dealer.
Minimum bid is 21 (dealer gets bid for 20 if it is left on him/her). 

The game is currently hosted at http://swffl.50megs.com/pinochle.html.
